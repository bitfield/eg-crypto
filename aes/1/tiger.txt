The tiger appears at its own pleasure. When we become very silent at that place, with no expectation of the tiger, that is when he chooses to appear... When we stand at the edge of the river waiting for the tiger, it seems that the silence takes on a quality of its own. The mind comes to a stop. In the Indian tradition that is the moment when the teacher says, “You are that. You are that silence. You are that.”
—Francis Lucille, “The Perfume of Silence”
